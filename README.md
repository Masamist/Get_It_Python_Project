## Introduction
I would like to introduce my web projects, that I enjoyed creating. On top of the focus on coding I was lucky to solely do the UX design for all the projects. Furthermore, utilising the process and procedures of agile prot, jecacting in the role of scrum master, developer, tester, business analyst, financial staff or even project manager. Each project demonstrates my achievements, growing skills, and opportunities for further growth.

## Project Overview
This App will solve a problem that has prevailed in our education system for far too long and brings the power of programming to the masses. 
The shift to working remotely and connecting people with the aid of computer technology has never been more apparent than in todayâ€™s current global environment. 
This trend is only accelerating with the development of technology itself and environmental factors like the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The need for custom-built apps and online tools has never been in such high demand. 
Thus, a growing pool of developers to build Software is required. However, the current approach to entering this industry is out of reach 
for most people due to prohibitive costs and the long-term commitment required when enrolled as a student in an institute. 
Our App can offer an alternative for many, by providing an Online content tutorial that enables users to learn code in their own time and pace, 
we provide an alternative entry point, allowing many who would otherwise be unable to join this growing industry.
